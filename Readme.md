# Moon Orbit Animation - Certification Project

## Overview

This project is part of the certification requirements. In this visual lab, I created an animated simulation of the **Moon orbiting the Earth** using pure CSS. The main objective was to practice using CSS animation properties to create smooth, realistic orbital motion.

## Project Details

- **Project Type**: CSS Animation / Visual Simulation
- **Purpose**: Understand key CSS animation properties by simulating orbital motion around a central object.
- **Skills Learned**: `@keyframes`, `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-iteration-count`, `animation-timing-function`, `transform`, `position`

## Features

- 🌍 **Earth & Moon System**: Visual representation of the Earth in the center with a moon rotating around it.
- 🌀 **Smooth Orbit Animation**: Created using keyframe animations and transform-based positioning.
- ⏱️ **Custom Timing Functions**: Explore the effect of `ease`, `linear`, and `cubic-bezier()` timing on motion.
- 🌌 **Visual Effects**: Styled with gradients, shadows, and optional stars background for immersion.
- 🔁 **Infinite Loop**: Animation runs continuously with a natural feel.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of planetary objects
- **CSS**: Animation properties, transforms, timing functions, and visual styling

## Installation
